They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.\n\nThe townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.\n\nThe mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  \"What happened?\" he asked, exasperated.\n\nThe old monk shook his head sadly. \"Isn't it obvious?\" he said. \"Sam sung Note 7.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!

You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\n.'

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n"}, {"id": "92qoa2", "title": "Hey girl are you a newspaper?", "text": "Because there's a new issue with you every fucking day"}, {"id": "99cwo9", "title": "Jared from Subway ended his career the same way he began it", "text": "Trying to get into smaller pants"}, {"id": "88iipf", "title": "Did you know if you hold your ear up too a strangers leg", "text": "You can actually hear them say \"what the fuck are you doing?\n\n"}, {"id": "84w9ks", "title": "Give a man a gun and he'll rob a bank,", "text": "Give a man a bank and he'll rob the world."}, {"id": "9dgti7", "title": "A man who just died is delivered to the mortuary wearing an expensive, expertly tailored black suit...", "text": "\n....

No!\"\n\nAs promised, the man's penis shrunk to 12 inches!

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.\n\nSam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.\n\nAnd on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... \n\nAnd the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.\n\nAnd on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.\n\nSuddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.

No!\" says the tramp, \"Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.\"\n\n\"Ten pounds,\" thinks the tramp, \"I'm rich! I'm rich!\" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.\n\nHe finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. \"I'll have one holiday please!\"\n\n\"Ahem, which holiday would sir like?\" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.\n\n\"Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,\" replies the tramp.\n\n\"TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,\" says the girl incredulously.\n\nShe goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.\n\n\"Well you'll never believe it,\" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. \"I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.\"\n\n\"Yippee!\" exclaims the tramp, \"I'll take it!\"\n\nA few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.\n\n\"Get off my ship ye dirty bum!\" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.\n\n\"But I've got my ticket!\", responds the tramp, \"super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!\"\n\n\"Well okay,\" says the captain, \"but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.\"\n\nSo the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.\n\n\"Psst,\" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.\n\n\"Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.\"\n\nThe tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!\n\nFirst they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6\" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.\n\nThen the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3\" deep, and so on...\n\n3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.\n\n\"Sheer luxury!\" exclaimed the tramp, \"A room of my very own.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" replies the captain, \"but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.\"\n\nWell the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...\n\nThen one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.\n\nHe climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...\n\n... and what a dive...!\n\nPerfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.\n\nNow unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.\n\n\"That was amazing!\" exclaimed the captain, \"Where did you learn to dive like that?\"\n\n\"Um, well I've never actually dived before,\" replied the tramp.\n\n\"Well that's incredible!\" says the captain, \"I've never seen...\" He broke off. \"Hey, I've got an idea\", he started again. \"How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!\"\n\n\"It's a deal!\" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.\n\nThen one morning the captain comes to talk. \"Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed the tramp.\n\nTwo days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.\n\n\"Well, tramp,\" said the captain, shaking his hand, \"Let's see what you can do.\" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...\n\nup and up...\n\nbelow him the ship grew smaller...\n\non and on...\n\npast a solitary albatross...\n\nand still higher...\n\ntill the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...\n\nand on still further...\n\n/ till the ocean grew dim...\n\nand the earth itself...\n\nbegan to shrink...\n\npast our moon...\n\nand on...\n\nand Mars...\n\nand on...\n\nhigher, and higher...\n\nthrough the asteroid belt...\n\nand on and on towards the diving board...\n\npast the outer planets, until...\n\non the outermost reaches of the Solar System...\n\nhe reached the board.\n\nHe climbed on top and radioed the captain...\n\nand then...\n\n.' '.\n. .\n. .\nhe jumped.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n:\nSlowly at first,\n:\nbut speeding up,\n:\n:\n:\nfaster, and faster,\n:\nspeeding past Pluto,\n:\nand the other outer planets,\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nthrough the asteroid belt,\n\npast Mars,\n\nand the moon,\n\nfaster,\n\nand faster,\n\nfaster - ever faster,\n\nand by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,\n\nfaster, and faster,\n\npast the albatross,\n\ndouble-back somersault,\n\nand he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,\n\nhurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,\n\nDown on the ship the crew strained their necks,\n\n\"I CAN SEE HIM!\" yelled a passenger, \"LOOK!!!\"\n\nThe tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...\n\nNOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE WATER!\n\nSMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!\n\nDOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!\n\nDOWN!\n\nDOWN!\n\nTHROUGH THE CREW'S QUARTERS!\n\nTHROUGH THE ENGINE ROOMS!\n\nSMASHING THROUGH HIS OWN LITTLE CABIN!\n\nAND DOWN THROUGH THE DOUBLE-STRENGTH STEEL HULL OF THE SHIP!\n\nSTILL DOWN...!\n\nDEEPER,\n\nDEEPER INTO THE MURKY DEPTHS,\n\nTILL.........\n\nSMASH!\n\nInto the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.\n\nDesperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.\n\nUp and up, desperate, gasping...\n\nOut of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.\n\n\"HERO!\" \"WONDERFUL!\" \"AMAZING!\" \"GOOD SHOW THAT!\"\n\nAnd handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.\n\n\"Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.\"\n\nThe tramp blushed.\n\nThe captain went on, \"but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.\"\n\nAnd the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: \"Well you see...\n\n\"For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95\"\n\nThe captain outrageously asked why.\n\nThe tramp said \n\n\"The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking different heroes, As for cost, we selected initial values based upon data from the Open Beta and other adjustments made to milestone rewards before launch.

Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.\n\n\"You're in the afterlife!\" he tells the man, \"But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.\"\n\nAll of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.\n\nThe beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. \"That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.\"\n\nSo the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.\n\n\"What are the odds?\" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. \"That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line.\" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.\n\nWhile he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, \"The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!\"\n\nSadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. \"Come,\" the beggar told him, \"I'll take you to the evening meal.\" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. \"That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,\" and then he added, \"and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!\"\n\nThe man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. \"What is it,\" he thought, \"that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?\" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.\n\nFifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.\n\nThe beggar laughed jovially. \"I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!\" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.\n\nSmiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. \"That's the line for the dragon meat,\" he said before turning to the next line, \"and that's the line for angeldust stew,\" then he paused, confused.\n\n\"What is it?\" the man asked his old friend.\n\nThe beggar replied, \"There appears to be no punchline.\"\n"}, {"id": "92qoa2", "title": "Hey girl are you a newspaper?", "text": "Because there's a new issue with you every fucking day"}, {"id": "99cwo9", "title": "Jared from Subway ended his career the same way he began it", "text": "Trying to get into smaller pants"}, {"id": "88iipf", "title": "Did you know if you hold your ear up too a strangers leg", "text": "You can actually hear them say \"what the fuck are you doing?\n\n"}, {"id": "84w9ks", "title": "Give a man a gun and he'll rob a bank,", "text": "Give a man a bank and he'll rob the world."}, {"id": "9dgti7", "title": "A man who just died is delivered to the mortuary wearing an expensive, expertly tailored black suit...", "text": "\n....

Ok let's go pay for this window\n\nThe couple arrives at the front door of the broken window house and rings the doorbell. A very well dressed man answers the door, \"Yeees..?\" \n\nHusband: \"Hi we're the ones that broke the window, are you the owner of the house?\"\n\nWell dressed man: \"oh no I am only the butler. Master is on the other room, follow me. \n\nThe couple follows the butler through the massive entry and into a wondrous library. In the center of which sits the master, staying intently at a vase that was broken, quite clearly by the golf ball.\n\nHusband: \"oh I am so sorry. My wife, you see, is learning golf. She didnt mean to..\"\n\nThe master interrupts in an understanding tone \"haha oh its alright. You see I'm a genie and I was trapped in that case for the last several hundred years. But you released me by breaking it. As you know genies grant 3 wishes. But since you did break the window I will save the third for myself, leave 1 each for you both. Madame would you like to go first?\"\n\nWife: \"uh I want lots of money....\"\n\n\"Done.\" Interrupts the master, \" I'll also make it theft proof, fire proof, and infinite. Anytime you need money no matter the amount, it will be in your account.\"\n\nWife: \"oh my goodness thank you so much!\"\n\n\"You're turn\", says the the master looking at the husband.\n\nHusband: \"I'd like a beautiful home in ever country.\"\n\nMaster: \"and you shall have it. Complete with protection from all the elements and a staff to maintain it and look after you when you stay.\"\n\nHusband: \" Jesus! thank you so much!\"\n\nMaster: \"not a problem. As for my wish, well I have been trapped in that case for so long and all the while without a woman. I am sorry but my wish is to have sex with your beautiful wife.\"\n\nHusband to wife: \"I don't know honey. I mean he did give us all that money and houses. You know how I feel about cheating but this seems different.\"\n\nWife: \"yeah I agree. I'm not thrilled about it but I get where he is coming from. Play well do it\"\n\nThe Master is thrilled and wisks the wife upstairs where they have loud, wall banging sex for hours on end. Finally after all that time the master comes down in only his underwear and his unbuttoned dress shirt. He grabs a cup of water and drinks the whole thing. The master then asks the nearby husband, \" if you dont mind me asking how old are you ans your wife?\"\n\nHusband: \" well I'm 32 and she is 34, why do you ask?\"\n\nMaster: \"just curious as to how you guys still believe in genies.....\n\n"}, {"id": "8pcli4", "title": "Why can\u2019t Lebron James stand on his tippy toes?", "text": "He gets no support from his Cavs"}, {"id": "7ze215", "title": "Do you ever just wake up and kiss the person sleeping beside you and feel glad that you are alive?", "text": "I just did and apparently I'm not allowed on this airline anymore..."}, {"id": "6dpi5q", "title": "The class comes in from recess and gets a spelling quiz...", "text": "\"Jimmy, what did you do during recess?\" asks the teacher. \n\"I played in the sand box with Sally!\" \n\"That's great!

The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him.
